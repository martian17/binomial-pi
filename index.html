        <h3>brief description:</h3>
        This program calculates π using random walk and normal distribution.<br>
        Given a fact that random walk results in a normal distribution, we can exploit this to calculate pi by reversing the equation of normal distribution which looks like the following.
        <br>
        f(x) = 1/(σ√(2π))*e^(-1/2*((x-μ)/σ)^2)<br>
        <br>
        in which<br>
        f(x) is the probability distribution,<br>
        σ is the standard deviation,<br>
        μ is the average.<br>
        <br>
        notice<br>
        f(μ) = 1/(σ√(2π))<br>
        therefore<br>
        π = 1/(2*σ^2*f(μ)^2)<br>
        <br>
        we can calculate μ and σ with commonly known means, and then we can calculate f(μ) by takeing a small strip from the distribution center, and dividing it with its width.<br>
